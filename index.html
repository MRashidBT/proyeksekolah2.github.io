    <h1>These are my hobbies</h1>
    <p>My name is Rashid, a 17-year-old with a passion for learning and personal growth. Born on March 13, 2007, I began my educational journey at Pribad Depok Elementary School before continuing at an Islamic boarding school for middle school. My background in theology has been a key area of interest and strength for me, supported by my IQ of 119, which drives my curiosity and analytical thinking. I strive to deepen my understanding of the world around me, especially through the lens of faith and knowledge.</p>
